Can I renew my driver license by Internet if I have a change of address at the same time?	No. A change of address is not accepted as part of the driver license renewal by internet process.

Do I need a smog certification? What if I haven't had my vehicle smog checked?	"The registration renewal notice mailed to you by the department will indicate if a smog certification is required. If a smog certification is required and you have not had a smog inspection, you may still pay your registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV.
